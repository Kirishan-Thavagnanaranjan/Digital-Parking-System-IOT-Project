Smart Parking System ðŸš—ðŸ”§
The Smart Parking System is an automated solution designed to efficiently manage parking spaces using IR sensors, ultrasonic sensors, servo motors, and an LCD display. It detects available slots, guides vehicles to park, and controls entry based on real-time slot availability.

ðŸ”¹ Features
Automated Entry & Exit: The entrance gate opens only when a parking slot is available.
Real-time Slot Detection: IR sensors detect whether a slot is occupied or free.
LCD Display Guidance: The screen provides a welcome message and directs drivers to an available slot.
LED Indicators: Green and red LEDs signal entry permission and parking status.
Ultrasonic Sensors: Detect vehicles at the entrance and exit gates.
ðŸ”¹ How It Works
A vehicle arrives at the entrance. The system checks for available slots.
If a slot is free, the LCD screen welcomes the driver and shows the slot number.
The entrance gate opens, allowing the vehicle to enter.
Once parked, IR sensors update the slot status as occupied.
When the vehicle exits, the slot status updates only after crossing the exit gate.
